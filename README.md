# Vite Three JS — Template

This boilerplate starter template is the ultimate solution to help you getting started on your project in no time, without the hassle of setting up and configuring your environment from scratch each time you start developing. <br />
It's ideal for front-end engineers who want to build modern, fast and reliable **webgl** web applications with the latest cutting edge technologies such as **Three.JS**, **GLSL**, **JavaScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **Vite**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **Husky** and much more!

## :battery: Features

This repository comes 🔋 packed with:

- **Three.JS**: A JavaScript library built on top of **WebGL** that provides an abstraction layer for rendering interactive 3D and 2D scenes in the web browser;
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides predefined classes for common styles and layout patterns, allowing quick styling without writing custom CSS;
- **SASS**: A CSS preprocessor that adds features such as variables, nesting, and mixins to CSS, making it easier to write and maintain large CSS codebases;
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins, allowing to add new features to CSS and improve the development process;
- **Playwright**: A library for automating web browser interactions, allowing the writing of end-to-end tests and perform browser automation tasks;
- **Vite**: A build tool and development server that provides fast and efficient development and production builds for modern web applications;

And with tools that enhance the development experience:

- **ESLint**: A tool for enforcing coding standards and identifying potential errors in the code;
- **Prettier**: A code formatter that automatically formats code to conform to a consistent style, making it easier to read and maintain;
- **Husky**: A Git hook manager that allows easy set up and configuration of Git hooks, which are scripts that run at certain points in the Git workflow;
- **Commitlint**: A tool for enforcing commit message conventions in Git repositories, helping to ensure consistent and informative commit messages;

## :arrows_clockwise: Versions

This repository comes configured with 2 of the industry standards for development tools: **Webpack** and **Vite**. <br />
Both tools support **SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)**, a **Rust-based compiler**; Vite is optimized for it out of the box.

### Vite (SWC compiler)

Is a simple and fast solution thanks to it's "zero-config" approach which offers a smoother development experience.

### Webpack (Babel compiler)

Is more a flexible solution, capable of handling complex configurations.

## :globe_with_meridians: Browsers support

The provided configuration ensures **92.3%** coverage for all browsers, in particular of the following:

|            Chrome             |             Firefox              |             Edge             |        Opera         | Safari                       |
| :---------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :------------------: | ---------------------------- |
| ![Google Chrome][chrome-icon] | ![Mozilla Firefox][firefox-icon] | ![Microsoft Edge][edge-icon] | ![Opera][opera-icon] | ![Apple Safari][safari-icon] |

**\*** In order to support a wider percentage of browsers, update the `./.browserslistrc` configuration file:

1. `last 3 versions`: browser version;
2. `> 0.2%`: browser usage statistics;
3. `not dead`: whether the browser is officially supported;

Update the configuration [here][browserslist] and check in real-time the **global browsers support**.

**\* The more versions to support, larger JS and CSS bundles size will be.**
